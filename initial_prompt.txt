I want to create a Kubernetes introductory workshop for bioinformaticians. We have a Kubernetes cluster and have CPU and GPU tasks. There will be most likely three use cases:

1) CPU based datascience notebook (jupyter notebbok web based access)
2) CPU based classical analysis pipeline using nextflow
3) GPU based deep learning approaches to train some transformer architecture on spatial omics dataset

For all three cases I want to have a template, that allows users to easily deploy a statefulset (1) and 3)) or deployment (2)), which allows the user to directly get started with their project.

Before I go into those usecases, I also need some introduction to the following concept:

Kubernetes in general (overview how it works)
our concrete Kubernetes cluster (I will provide and overview about the resources / nodes)
namespaces (isolating environments vs sharing)
pod, deployment, statefulset, ingress (differences, when to use what)
data access (mounting data vs internal data for a pod) and persistence
Create some markdown sections for all of the introduction pieces. Each section should also have a suitable small example script for a user who doesn't have the admin role for the cluster, so just show the pods for example or investigate a deployment and create a template from that.

Then go into the three usecase with a small motivation and the final commands / yaml templates.

This will all go into a github repository, so take into account that there is a .env and .env.example (is the template for the .env file) which I use in order to fill in the sensitive information. Make use of environment variables in that regard, for example for IP-adresses, user and namespace names.
