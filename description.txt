Description: 
This hands-on workshop is designed for bioinformaticians, computational biologists, 
and biomedical researchers who want to use Kubernetes for scalable scientific computing. 
Whether you're running CPU-intensive genomics pipelines, 
interactive data analysis notebooks, or GPU-accelerated machine learning models, 
this workshop will teach you how to deploy and manage your computational workloads 
on our Kubernetes cluster. 

We'll cover both theoretical concepts and practical implementation, with ready-to-use templates 
for common use cases. Participants should have basic command-line experience 
and familiarity with containerization concepts (Docker).

Topics:

- Kubernetes fundamentals and architecture for scientific computing (~15 minutes)
- Live demo of common use cases (~15 minutes)
- Practical session (~30 minutes)
  - Deploying interactive Jupyter notebooks
  - Running scalable bioinformatics pipelines using Nextflow on Kubernetes
  - GPU-based deep learning workflows in VSCode

Prerequisites:

Basic command-line/terminal experience
Familiarity with Docker containers (preferred but not required)
Basic knowledge about at least one of the tools: Jupyter notebooks, VSCode or Nextflow

What you'll take away:

Production-ready Kubernetes templates for your research
Practical skills to deploy and manage computational workloads
Understanding of cloud-native approaches to bioinformatics
Troubleshooting skills for common Kubernetes issues
